Most of my working background is in retail, but I have always wanted to work within the tech industry. I love exploring new technologies and finding out what makes them tick and I'm always on the lookout for something new to learn.
I want to take this natural curiosity and apply it to web development.

## Skills

### Communication
I've worked in customer facing roles my entire working life so effectively communicating with people from all walks of life has always been a big part of what I do. During the course I've been complemented several times on my ability to take a complex subject or task and break it down into easy to understand ideas.

### Fast Learner
I'm able to pick up new technologies relatively quickly - during my first project at Makers, we built and AirBnB clone using Javascript, Node, Express, Postgress, Sequelize in a week with no prior exposure to Node and only a couple of weeks Javascript exposure.
